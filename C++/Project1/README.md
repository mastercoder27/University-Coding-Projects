BACKGROUND:

You are a new programmer with Piedmont Accident Analysts, Inc. (PAAI).  The Department of Transportation (DOT) 
Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) awarded PAAI a valuable data analysis contract.  
PHMSA guidelines state that "Each operator of a hazardous liquid pipeline system shall file Form PHMSA F 7000-1 
for an accident that meets the criteria in 49 CFR ยง195.50 as soon as practicable but not more than 30 days after 
discovery of the accident.  Requirements for submitting reports are in ยง195.54 and ยง195.58."  This process involves 
a considerable amount of manual data collection, significant duplication of effort, and redundant data entry.  PAAI 
is tasked to develop object-oriented software that will modernize and streamline PHMSA's reporting processes.
