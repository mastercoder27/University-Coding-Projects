THE TEMPORARY PUMP IS EQUIPPED WITH PRESSURE SWITCHES FOR HIGH PRESSURE AND LOW PRESSURE SHUT DOWN IF THE SUCTION OR DISCHARGE MOVE BEYOND THE DESIRED OPERATING PRESSURE. AFTER THE INITIAL RESPONSE TO STOP THE RELEASE, MEDALLION IDENTIFIED THE SOURCE OF THE RELEASE TO BE A CRACK IN THE THREADS OF A 1À NIPPLE. AN INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT THE NIPPLE THAT FAILED HAD CRACKED DUE TO VIBRATION ON THE LINE RESULTING IN A MIST OIL BEING SPRAYED INTO THE AIR AND RELEASING A TOTAL 40 BBLS OF OIL ONTO THE GROUND, IMPACTING APPROXIMATELY 4000 CUBIC FEET OF SOIL.

LINE 01 WAS REPAIRED WITH A TYPE B WEDDING BAND SLEEVE OVER AN A SLEEVE AND RESTARTED AT 14:38 ON 3/1/16. CAUSE OF RELEASE IS UNDER INVESTIGATION AS THE SOURCE WAS UNDER AN A SLEEVE. THE SITE IS BEING REMEDIATED BY REMOVING ALL CONTAMINATED SOIL. ESTIMATED RELEASE TOTAL IS 350 GALLONS, ALL FROM THE SOIL VOLUME CALCULATION. THERE WAS NO MEASURABLE PRODUCT CONTAINED IN WATER REMOVED FROM THE SITE, BUT THERE WAS SOME PRODUCT OBSERVED ON THE GROUNDWATER. APPROXIMATELY 2,700 TONS OF SOIL WILL BE EXCAVATED AND TO DATE 130,000 GALLONS OF WATER HAS BEEN HAULED OFF FOR TREATMENT. SOIL AND WATER ARE BEING TREATED AT LOCAL, APPROVED FACILITIES. GROUNDWATER WAS IMPACTED AND MONITORING WELLS WILL BE INSTALLED TO FACILITATE SITE CLOSURE. THERE WERE NO IMPACTS TO WILDLIFE. 6/20/16 SUPPLEMENT IS TO UPDATE ESTIMATED VOLUME RELEASED AND VOLUME RECOVERED BASED ON ACTUAL REMEDIATION RESULTS. INCIDENT ANALYSIS HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETED AND PLANS ARE UNDERWAY TO REMOVE THE SECTION OF PIPE THAT WILL UNDERGO METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS LATER IN THE YEAR. A TOTAL OF 7,026 TONS OF SOIL WAS EXCAVATED FROM THE SITE. THE AVERAGE CONCENTRATION OF GRO AND DRO IN THE SOIL WAS 216 MG/KG AND 40 MG/KG RESPECTIVELY. THE FINAL CALCULATED VOLUME OF PETROLEUM CONTAINED IN THE SOIL REMOVED IS 576 GALLONS. SINCE NO MEASURABLE PRODUCT WAS CONTAINED IN THE RECOVERED GROUNDWATER, THE FINAL RELEASE VOLUME IS 576 GALLONS."

HEP TERMINAL TECH ARRIVED TO THE TERMINAL AT ABOUT 19:30, AND HEP TERMINAL SUPERVISOR ARRIVED @ 19:35. HEP CONTROL CENTER WAS NOTIFIED TO SHUT UNIT 2 DOWN. THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO BE A FAILURE OF THE UNIT 2 INBOARD BEARING THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE INBOARD SEAL FAIL. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE SEAL FAILED IN SUCH A WAY THAT ADEQUATE PRESSURE DID NOT TRANSMIT TO THE SEAL FAIL DIAPHRAGM SWITCH RESULTING IN NO ALARM ACTIVATION AND NO AUTOMATIC SHUTDOWN OF THE PUMP UNIT BY THE CONTROLS SYSTEM. THE SEAL FAILURE ALLOWED PRODUCT (GASOLINE) BEING RELEASED TO ENTER THE INBOARD BEARING OIL RESERVOIR THROUGH THE SHAFT LABYRINTH SEAL. THE GASOLINE IN THE BEARING HOUSING DILUTED THE LUBRICITY OF THE BEARING OIL TO THE POINT THAT THE BEARING OVERHEATED. THE OVERHEATING OF THE BEARING RESULTED IN DAMAGE TO THE PUMP UNIT SHAFT THAT BEGAN TEARING ITSELF APART AND CREATED AN IGNITION SOURCE. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE BEARING TEMPERATURE INCREASE DID NOT ACTIVATE AN ALARM DUE TO THE LOCATION OF THE BEARING RTD (RESISTANCE TEMPERATURE DETECTOR). THE BEARING RTD MEASURED THE TEMPERATURE OF THE LUBRICATING OIL BATH IN THE BEARING HOUSING WHICH WAS BEING COOLED BY THE FLOOD OF COLD PRODUCT REPLACING THE LUBRICATING OIL. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS 1. UNIT RETROFIT AND INSTALLATION OF TANDEM MECHANICAL SEALS AS WELL AS REPLACING THE LABYRINTH SEAL DESIGN. 2. RELOCATION OF THE BEARING RTD TO READ ACTUAL BEARING TEMPERATURE AND NOT THE LUBRICATING OIL TEMPERATURE. 3.

THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS HAVE BEEN DETERMINED BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS AND INVESTIGATION: - A _À ROOT VALVE DESIGNED TO BE OPEN DURING NORMAL OPERATION WAS NEARLY CLOSED, NOT ALLOWING WATER TO DRAIN FROM THE TUBING LEG. - THE SPLIT IN THE TUBING WAS DUE TO WATER FREEZING INSIDE THE TUBE CAUSING DUCTILE TEARING FROM INTERNAL PRESSURE GENERATED FROM THE EXPANSION OF WATER FREEZING INTO ICE. - WATER WAS MOST LIKELY INTRODUCED FROM A METER PROVER CONNECTION. - A WATER DRAW TEST WAS PREVIOUSLY PERFORMED ON THE PROVER AND RESIDUAL AMOUNTS OF WATER WERE NOT REMOVED. - THE _ ROOT VALVE CONNECTING TO THE THERMAL RELIEF WAS NOT IDENTIFIED AS A CRITICAL DEVICE THAT SHOULD BE LEFT OPEN DURING NORMAL OPERATION. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: - THE WATER DRAW PROCEDURE WILL BE REVISED WITH SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CONTRACTOR TO DRY THE PROVER LOOP AFTER THE WATER DRAW. - OPERATIONS WILL VERIFY NO FREE LIQUIDS ARE IN THE PROVER PRIOR TO INSTALLATION AFTER THE WATER DRAW TEST.
